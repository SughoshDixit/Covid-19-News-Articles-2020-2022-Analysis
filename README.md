# Covid-19-News-Articles-2020-2022-Analysis

COVID-19 has impacted the world significantly since its outbreak in 2019. With the rapid spread of the virus and its continuous mutations, keeping up with the latest news and research about the virus is essential.

In this dataset, we are provided with a dataset of COVID news articles collected from various sources from 2020 to 2022. The dataset includes articles related to COVID-19's impact on health, society, politics, economy, and technology.

The goal of this analysis is to create a knowledge graph that captures the relationships and entities mentioned in these articles. Specifically, we want to extract the following information from the dataset:
Identify the named entities mentioned in the articles (such as countries, organizations, people, and diseases).

Extract the relationships between entities mentioned in the articles (such as "Person X works for Organization Y").

Identify the key topics and subtopics discussed in the articles (such as "Vaccine development," "Lockdown measures," or "COVID-19 variants").

Analyze the sentiment of the articles towards these topics (positive, negative, or neutral).
